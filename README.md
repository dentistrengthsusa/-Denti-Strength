<h3 data-end="1495" data-start="1453">Why Traditional Oral Care Isn&rsquo;t Enough</h3>
<p data-end="1689" data-start="1497">Most people rely on brushing, flossing, and occasional dental cleanings to keep their teeth healthy. While these habits are essential, they only address the surface of the problem. Here's why:</p>
